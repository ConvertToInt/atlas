            We’ve had the absolute delight of working with the Scottish Government, Police Scotland, Scottish
            Children’s Reporter Administration, Employers Network for Equality &amp; Inclusion (ENEI), Inverclyde
            Carers Centre, and other organisations to raise autism acceptance across communities in Scotland.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            We offer bespoke training workshops to audiences from all ages and backgrounds but always do
            our best to highlight specific strategies and scenarios that will be relevant to the attendees.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            We believe it’s important that everyone has an opportunity to gain a more in depth understanding
            of autism, because autism friendly communities are ultimately people friendly communities.
            There’s no strategy that is exclusive to people with autism, and you may find that some strategies
            we suggest can help non-autistic individuals, and maybe yourself!

                                        Our award-winning play, ‘In Our World: A Day on the Spectrum’ explores navigating daily life
                                        through the lens of people with autism across the spectrum. Each sketch explores themes
                                        including: bullying, daily routines, using public transport, school, work, sensory issues, criminal
                                        justice and more!

                                        Like all our other training, where we mention specific challenges for autistic individuals, we
                                        provide strategies that can be used to improve good autism practice. At the end of every
                                        performance, we allow members of the audience to ask questions about the performance as well
                                        as general questions about autism (and we always say - no question is a daft one!)

                                        We’ve performed scenes of our play at our local theatre (on smaller and bigger stages!), for
                                        schools, employers, civil servants, police officers and even the First Minister and the Cabinet in
                                        2017. We’ve had fantastic opportunity after fantastic opportunity, and it could not be done
                                        without the incredible collaboration from members of the wider community.

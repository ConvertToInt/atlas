                        “Autism acceptance for myself is the knowledge that my needs are recognised and actions have been put in place to accommodate them. Without 
                        acceptance of autism there are no adaptations being made for autistic individuals to feel accepted and safe. People may be aware of my autism 
                        but that doesn't necessarily mean they will be accepting when I display more unusual symptoms or request changes to be made so that I can feel 
                        comfortable. Awareness means knowing I'm here, acceptance means you understand how much it took for me to be here.”
